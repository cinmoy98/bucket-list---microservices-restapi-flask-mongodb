We discover numerous intriguing blogs, YouTube links, and other travel blogs that
we want to add to our bucket list when surfing on internet daily. Here, I developed
a bucket list manager. Users will be able to sort, filter, and search before
visiting specific cities by storing their visited URLs in our app. For increased
availability and scalability, employed a microservices-based architecture. JWT
token-based authentication will be introduced to ensure greater security. uWSGI and Nginx both will be used for traffic load
balancing, multiprocessing, and multithreading. As frontend, bucket, authentication, database - these three services
are docker containerized and independent of each other, if any service goes down other two will still be running.I developed this app to learn latest cutting edge technologies. One can refer this repo to learn backend and system design from scratch.
